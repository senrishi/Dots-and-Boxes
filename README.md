# Dots-and-Boxes

### Latest code is final_v5.cpp
### Minimax algo with alpha beta pruning and eval used to battle in dots and boxes.

## WIP
- Dimensions of grid hard coded according to the challenge.
- Better heuristics (current heuristics only assign scores according to number of 3 sided boxes that belongs to the player)
- Depth set to 3 for now to prevent timeouts
